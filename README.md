Auto-Coder is a command-line tool with YAML-based configuration that can automatically develop your existing project based on your requirements. 

The programming experience with an auto-coder is similar to upgrading from a carriage driver to a car driver. You need to be patient and learn to use the auto-coder as a professional skill and tool. It usually takes weeks or even months and requires changing many of your driving habits to truly achieve a significant (may 3-5) productivity improvement.

The new way of your development is: 

1. to write a YAML file to describe your requirements, and the auto-coder will generate the code 
and merge the code into your project.
2. check the commits from the auto-coder and review the code in vscode or other IDEs.
3. if the commits are correct, you may still need to manually modify the code if necessary with the help of github copilot or other tools.
4. if the commits are incorrect, you need to revert the commits and modify the YAML file to make the auto-coder generate the correct code.
5. repeat the above steps until you are satisfied with the code generated by the auto-coder.


## Installation

```shell
conda create --name autocoder python=3.10.11
conda activate autocoder
pip install -U auto-coder
## if you want to use private/open-source models, uncomment this line.
# pip install -U vllm
ray start --head
```
